# iOS Companion App

This folder contains a starter SwiftUI companion app for Apple Health access.

## What is included

- `JarvisHealthApp.swift`: SwiftUI entry point
- `ContentView.swift`: simple connect/status screen
- `HealthKitManager.swift`: HealthKit authorization and sample reads
- `Info.plist`: privacy usage descriptions
- `JarvisHealth.entitlements`: enables the HealthKit capability

## What is not included

This workspace does not currently have a working Xcode project file because the active developer tools on this machine do not include full Xcode. To finish setup:

1. Open Xcode on your Mac.
2. Create a new iOS App project named `JarvisHealth`.
3. Replace the generated Swift files with the files from this folder.
4. Replace the generated `Info.plist` values with the entries in this folder.
5. Add the `JarvisHealth.entitlements` file to the target.
6. In Signing & Capabilities, add the `HealthKit` capability.
7. Build and run on your iPhone.
8. The app now supports `Production`, `Local`, and `Custom` server modes in-app.

Default plist values:

- `JarvisProductionAPIBaseURL=https://jarvis.jarom.ink/api`
- `JarvisLocalAPIBaseURL=http://192.168.0.198:8000/api`

You can still update these defaults in `Info.plist`, but the app now lets you switch servers without editing the plist every time.

## Initial data types requested

- Steps
- Heart rate
- Sleep analysis
- Active energy burned
- Workouts

## Movement journal starter

The app now also includes a first-pass `Core Location` movement journal:

- requests location authorization
- monitors visits and significant movement in the background
- uses standard location updates only while the app is active for richer route detail
- stores a local day log with visits and route points
- syncs a daily movement summary to `POST /api/movement/daily`

This is a V1 foundation for:

- total distance traveled
- number of visited places
- arrival/departure timeline
- approximate route polyline
- commute start/end heuristics
- movement story summaries

## Important iOS behavior

If the user force-quits the app from the app switcher, iOS may stop background delivery until the app is opened again. Ordinary backgrounding should continue to collect movement events after location permission is granted.

## Next step

After permission succeeds, the app can now post a daily health summary to the Jarvis backend with the `Sync to Jarvis` button.
